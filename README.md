# Tumor Classification:
This project aims to classify tumors based on MRI scans from the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). This project is also for me to understand how to leverage modern computer vision libraries to apply what i have learned in theory to practice.
Multiple pre-trained models will be utilized for the dataset for comparison.
# TODO:
- |  / |  Data Exploration and Visualization.
  |\/  |

- |    |  Utilize different pre-trained models(VGG16, ResNet, Unet)
  |    |  to classify the MRI scans and evaluate each model.

- |    |  Fine tune the models to achieve maximum possible accuracy
  |    |  above the baseline

- |    |  Implement GRAD-CAM segmentation to localize tumors in a 
  |    |  given MRI scan.

- [    ]  Implement the CLI for storing patient data and classify 
  [    ]  tumors on a per-patient basis,along with authentication of the user.
