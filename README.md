# Tumor Classification:
This project aims to classify tumors based on MRI scans from the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). This project is also for me to understand how to leverage modern computer vision libraries to apply what i have learned in theory to practice. I will be using Python@3.12 for this implementation due to Python's extensive open source libraries.

# TODO:
- [  ] - Data Exploration and Visualization.
- [  ] - Image Annotation for training the model.
- [  ] - Implement Computer Vision Model and train it using the provided training set.
- [  ] - Use the test dataset for validation of accuracy of the model.
- [  ] - Hyper-Parameter Tuning to ensure maximum possible accuracy.
- [  ] - Implement A Web Client to serve as an interface for the Model along with patient details.
